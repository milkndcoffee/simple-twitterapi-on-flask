# simple-twitterapi-on-flask
Project study utilizing Flask, python, and python-twitter .

## Installing
Just clone and install requirements.txt and you're set :)
<br>
to clone:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/milkndcoffee/simple-twitterapi-on-flask.git
$ cd simple-twitterapi-on-flask
```

install requirements.txt:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Starting localhost
So first you would need to activate the env. I'm unsure of how other OS would handle this but if you have Windows10:
```
.\env\Scripts\activate.ps1
```
Then simply run `app.py` to start the localhost server and you should be set (fingers crossed)!


## Questions?
Just private message me or you could email me! This may not startup perfectly for people as I am currently up late writing this right now. 
But if this project does pique someone's interest and it is not working, by all means send me a message!

## Ty for your time :)
Hi, milkndcoffee here. This is definitely my first Flask project and it was quite entertaining to code. 
I only decided to create this because I had to put a react project put on hold as I had a dumb (but at that time, a smart) idea to grab data from my Flask project onto my React.
<br><br>
Haha ; . ; .. nonetheless, I'm glad I learned a bit about Flask through this. 
<br><br>
Lastly, a huge amount of thanks to python-twitter for simplifying the process of requesting data from the Twitter API!
